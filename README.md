# chess3
#This project is an realization of experimental board game "Chess for three".
#It is written in Python2.7 language, using PyQt4.8 package for GUI.
#
#This realisation consists of client and server programs.
#After launching client, user should enter his name and ip-address of server.
#Client tries to connect to server and send data. Server responds with id of this client (player).
#
#This project was tested fine using local network, but it was impossible to set connection between client and server with dynamic IP.
